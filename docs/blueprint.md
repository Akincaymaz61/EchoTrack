## Style Guidelines:

- The design uses a dark color scheme for low light and comfortable prolonged use.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for focus and visual appeal. It is a vibrant color that provides a striking contrast to the dark background.
- Background color: Dark slate gray (#2F4F4F), almost the same hue as the primary, but very desaturated, to maintain a sleek and modern appearance.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF), an analogous color to the primary, but brighter and with greater saturation, to highlight interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Use Space Grotesk for its computerized feel and Inter for readability in longer content.
- Use minimalist icons with electric blue accents to represent different radio stations and actions (play, pause, favorite).
- Implement a clean, card-based layout for song entries, ensuring easy readability and visual hierarchy.
- Subtle animations for track loading and transitions to enhance the user experience.
